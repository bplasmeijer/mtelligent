          <p class="lead">The section below is an experiment in action. Just by visiting you are automatically assigned a hypothesis and the text below will look and read differently depending on which hypothesis you were selected to receive. Click the button, or don't click the button. In the end the Mtelligent framework will tell you which text is more effective at getting your users to click the button.</p>

          <h2>How it Works</h2>
          <p>The code to produce the above result is pretty simple:</p>
          <p><pre>
&lt;h3 style=&quot;color:@@Html.GetHypothesisVariable(&quot;Honey vs Vinegar&quot;, &quot;TitleColor&quot;)&quot;&gt;@@Html.GetHypothesisVariable(&quot;Honey vs Vinegar&quot;, &quot;Title&quot;)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;@@Html.GetHypothesisVariable(&quot;Honey vs Vinegar&quot;, &quot;Copy&quot;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;@@Html.GetHypothesisVariable(&quot;Honey vs Vinegar&quot;, &quot;Image Source&quot;)&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;</pre></p>
          <p>The framework automatically looks up the experiment, assigns a hypothesis and returns any variable your request. On the post, here is the code that registers the conversion and then changes the response method depending on which hypothosis you are associated with.</p>
          <p><pre>
ExperimentManager.Current.AddConversion("Honey vs Vinegar");

if (ExperimentManager.Current.GetHypothesis("Honey vs Vinegar").SystemName == "Honey")
{
    ViewBag.Message = "Thanks you so much you wonderful user.";
}
else
{
    ViewBag.Message = "We knew you would do as you were told. Carry on worm.";
}
             </pre></p>
